Use that to make items.

To make an item, add an X in between the [] and then create the item using the item maker. If you want to add an item you want done to the list just add another entry with this template:
[] - ITEM NAME
For example;
[ X ] - Bananas
Is an item that has been created.
[] - Bananas
Is an item that hasn’t been created yet.

WHEN MAKING ITEMS:
At the top of the item, add a small description (put -- at the front of the line to make it a comment and not code-based) of what the item will be crafted into, if applicable eg:
-- 3DS XL will be crafted into x1 Circuit Board, x1 Glass, x1 Plastic, x1 Gold, x1 Copper
-- Lightbulb will be crafted into x1 Copper x1 Glass
This is a note for me later when I go to make craftables.
